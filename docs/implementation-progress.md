# Seamless Tiling Implementation Progress

## Completed ✓

### Phase 1: Voronoi Tiling (COMPLETE)

**Compute Shader Updates** (`src/voronoi_heightmap_compute.glsl`):
- ✅ Added spatial hash functions (`hash()`, `random_float()`)
- ✅ Removed dependency on pre-generated points buffer
- ✅ Generate points on-the-fly for 3x3 tile neighborhood
- ✅ Added push constants for tile position (`tile_world_x`, `tile_world_y`)
- ✅ Added global seed parameter
- ✅ Implemented world-space coordinate system
- ✅ Calculate height based on world position, not normalized coordinates

**GDScript Generator Updates** (`src/voronoi_generator.gd`):
- ✅ Added `tile_x` and `tile_y` properties
- ✅ Removed point generation code (now done in shader)
- ✅ Updated push constants to include tile position and seed
- ✅ Removed points buffer creation
- ✅ Updated debug output to show tile position

**Testing Infrastructure** (`test_tiling.gd`):
- ✅ Created test script for 4x4 tile grid generation
- ✅ Automatic tile generation loop
- ✅ Individual tile export (PNG + EXR)
- ✅ Composite image generation from tiles
- ✅ Automated seamlessness verification
- ✅ Console reporting with statistics

**Key Achievements**:
- Tiles can be generated independently in any order
- Same tile coordinates always produce identical results (deterministic)
- Tile boundaries mathematically guaranteed to be seamless
- Each pixel sees the same Voronoi points regardless of which tile generates it

### Phase 2: Erosion Tiling

This phase requires more extensive changes due to the causal nature of erosion simulation.

**Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

**Remaining Work**:

1. **Erosion Compute Shader** (`src/erosion_compute.glsl`):
   - [ ] Add spatial hash functions (same as Voronoi)
   - [ ] Remove dependency on pre-generated `random_indices` buffer
   - [ ] Generate droplet positions deterministically from tile coordinates
   - [ ] Support extended map size (with padding)
   - [ ] Add push constants for tile position and padding size
   - [ ] Implement boundary checking (droplets that leave extended region)

2. **Erosion Generator** (`src/erosion_generator.gd`):
   - [ ] Add `tile_x`, `tile_y`, and `padding_pixels` properties
   - [ ] Implement `calculate_affected_droplets()` function
   - [ ] Generate extended heightmap with Voronoi
   - [ ] Calculate which droplets could affect the tile
   - [ ] Sort droplets by global deterministic order
   - [ ] Run erosion on extended map
   - [ ] Extract center region (discard padding)

3. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Add erosion test to `test_tiling.gd`
   - [ ] Generate 4x4 grid with erosion
   - [ ] Verify seamlessness of eroded terrain
   - [ ] Performance profiling

**Estimated Complexity**: High
- Erosion is order-dependent (causality issues)
- Requires padding system for boundary handling
- Need to determine affected droplets from neighboring tiles
- Must maintain deterministic ordering across tiles

### Phase 3: Integration with Terrain System

**Planned Work**:

1. **TerrainManager Updates** (`src/terrain-system.gd`):
   - [ ] Replace placeholder heightmap generation with tiled generators
   - [ ] Add tile caching system
   - [ ] Integrate Voronoi + Erosion pipeline
   - [ ] Handle on-demand tile generation based on camera position
   - [ ] Implement tile unloading for memory management

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - [ ] Profile tile generation performance
   - [ ] Implement async/threaded generation
   - [ ] Add LOD system (lower resolution for distant tiles)
   - [ ] Optimize droplet search radius calculation

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - [ ] Biome blending between different terrain types
   - [ ] Save/load tile cache to disk
   - [ ] Progressive refinement (generate low-res first, refine later)

## Technical Details

### Voronoi Tiling Algorithm (Implemented)

```
For tile at (tx, ty):
  1. Calculate world bounds: [tx*size, ty*size] to [(tx+1)*size, (ty+1)*size]
  2. For each neighboring tile in 3x3 grid:
     a. Hash tile position to get deterministic seed
     b. Generate N points in world-space coordinates
  3. For each pixel in current tile:
     a. Convert to world coordinates
     b. Find nearest point from all 9 tiles' points
     c. Calculate height based on distance
```

**Seamlessness Guarantee**:
- Pixels at tile edges see same points regardless of generating tile
- Distance calculations identical → same height values

### Erosion Tiling Algorithm (Designed)

```
For tile at (tx, ty):
  1. Create extended map: size + 2*padding
  2. Fill with Voronoi in world-space (covers padding region)
  3. Determine affected droplets:
     a. Calculate max travel distance
     b. Find all tiles within search radius
     c. Generate droplets for those tiles (deterministic)
     d. Filter to droplets that could reach extended region
  4. Sort droplets by global deterministic order
  5. Simulate all affected droplets on extended map
  6. Extract center region, discard padding
```

**Seamlessness Guarantee**:
- Same droplets simulated in same order → same result
- Padding captures effects from neighboring regions
- Deterministic ordering ensures consistency

## Current Limitations

1. **Headless Mode**: GPU compute shaders require rendering context
   - Tests must run in Godot editor, not headless mode
   - Affects automation and CI/CD workflows

2. **Memory Usage**: Extended maps use more memory during generation
   - 256x256 tile with 128px padding = 512x512 temporary map (4x memory)
   - Mitigated by freeing after extracting center

3. **Erosion Complexity**: Compute shader refactor is non-trivial
   - Need to replace buffer-based approach with on-the-fly generation
   - Droplet determination logic complex (spatial search)
